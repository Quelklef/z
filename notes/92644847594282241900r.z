[:second-countable:]

- A [[topological space]] $$X$$ is called __second-countable__ iff it has a [[topological basis]] which is countable
- 
- Examples:
    - $$\mathbb R$$ -- take the collection of all open intervals with rational endpoints; this is a countable basis
    - Similarly, $$\mathbb R^n$$ and even $$\mathbb R^\omega$$
- Easily stronger than being [[first-countable]]
