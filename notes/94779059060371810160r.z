title: metric spaces are complete if every Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence

- [[JRM:Top.2]] 43.1
- If $$X$$ is a [[metric space]] where ever [[Cauchy sequence]] has a convergent subsequence, then $$X$$ is a [[complete metric space]]
- Relaxes the standard requirement for completeness that Cauchy sequences themselves must converge
