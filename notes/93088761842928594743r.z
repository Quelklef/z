[:infinite product topology:] [:product topology:]

- The infinite product topology is a generalization of the [[finite product topology]] to infinite products.
- For some infinite product $$\prod_\alpha X_\alpha$$, we give it the topology generated by the [[topological basis]] of sets of the form $$\prod_\alpha U_\alpha$$ where each $$U_\alpha$$ is open in $$X_\alpha$$ **and** for __only__ finitely many $$\alpha$$ is $$U_\alpha \neq X_\alpha$$
    - This differs from the [[box topology]] only in the text after "and"
    - The subbasis is thus given by sets of a similar form but where at exactly __one__ $$U_\alpha \neq X_\alpha$$
