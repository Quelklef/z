[:subspace and connectedness:]

- [[JRM:Top.2]] 23.2
- For some [[topological space]] $$X$$, if two sets $$C$$ and $$D$$ form a [[separation]], and if $$Y$$ is some [[connected]] [[subspace topology]] of $$X$$, then $$Y$$ must lie __entirely__ in $$C$$ or $$D$$; i.e., one of the following is true:
    - $$Y \subseteq C$$ and $$Y \cap D = \varnothing$$; or
    - $$Y \subseteq D$$ and $$Y \cap C = \varnothing$$
