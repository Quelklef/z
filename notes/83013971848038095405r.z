title: convergent sequences under continuous functions

- [[JRM:Top.2]] thm 21.3 (generalized in ยง30)
- Take $$f : X \to Y$$.
    - If $$f$$ is continuous, then for each convergent sequence $$x_n \to x$$ in $$X$$, the sequence $$f(x_n)$$ converges to $$f(x)$$
    - If $$X$$ is [[first-countable]], then the converse holds
