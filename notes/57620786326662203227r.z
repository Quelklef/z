[:semantic-dependent parsing:]

- a tweet from me:
    - We like to talk about the 'syntax and semantics' of a (natural) language as if they're independent, but aren't they very much not independent?

As in, there are sentences we would be unable to parse without knowing the meanings of the words, right?
