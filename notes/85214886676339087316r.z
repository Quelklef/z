title: equivalent conditions of open coverings on regular spaces

- [[JRM:Top.2]] 41.3
- Take a [[regular]] space $$X$$. Then [[TFAE]]. Every [[open covering]] of $$X$$ has a refinement that is:
    - A [[countably locally finite]] [[open covering]] of $$X$$
    - A [[locally finite]] [[covering]] of $$X$$
    - A [[locally finite]] [[closed covering]] of $$X$$
    - A [[locally finite]] [[open covering]] of $$X$$
