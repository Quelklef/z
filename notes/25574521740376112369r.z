title: subbasis, basis, topology

- Take a set $$X$$
- Let $$\mathscr S$$ be a set of subsets of $$X$$ which [[cover]]s $$X$$. Then $$\mathscr S$$ is a [[topological subbasis]]
- Let $$\mathscr B$$ be the set of finite unions of $$\mathscr S$$. Then $$\mathscr S$$ is a [[topological basis]] (see [[subbasis to basis]])
- $$\mathscr S$$ and $$\mathscr B$$ generate the same topology
