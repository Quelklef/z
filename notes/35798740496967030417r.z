[:one-point compactification:]

- $$Y$$ is said to be a __one-point compactification__ of $$X$$ if it is a [[compactification]] of $$X$$ and $$\lvert Y - X \rvert = 1$$
- As per [[locally compact Hausdorff via compactification]], a space $$X$$ has a one-point compactification if and only if it is [[locally compact]], [[Hausdorff]], but not [[compact]]
    - Further, all such one-point compactifications are homeomorphic, so we may speak of "the" one-point compactification
