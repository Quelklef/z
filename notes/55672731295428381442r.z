[:Cauchy sequence:]

- A sequence of numbers $$(x_n)$$ is said to be __Cauchy__ if its tail gets arbitrarily tight; that is, if for every $$\varepsilon > 0$$ exists some $$N$$ for which $$d(x_n, x_m) < \varepsilon$$ whenever $$n, m \geq N$$
- Note that this is generic over the metric $$d$$
- Convergent sequences are all Cauchy
