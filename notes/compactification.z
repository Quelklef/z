If:
  1. $$Y$$ is a compact Hausdorff topological space
  2. $$X \subsetneq Y$$ is a proper subspace topology of $$Y$$
  3. The closure $$\bar X$$ is equal to $$Y$$ (i.e. $$X$$ is dense in $$Y$$)

Then we call $$Y$$ a [:compactification:] of $$X$$


Two compactifications $$Y_1$$ and $$Y_2$$ are considered equivalent if there's a homeomorphism $$f : Y_1 \to Y_2$$ between them such that $$f$$ is the identity function on $$X$$.
