[:closed:] [:closed set:] [:closed sets:]

Within a topological space $$(X, \tau)$$, a set $$U \subseteq X$$ is called \i[closed] iff its complement $$X - U$$ is an open set.

One can rewrite the topology axioms in terms of closed sets as follows:
  1. $$\varnothing$$ and $$X$$ are closed
  2. The space is closed under arbitrary intersection
  3. The space is closed under finite union
Note the duality!
