[:production system:]

- A production system is essentially a bunch of production rules on a finite alphabet $$\Sigma$$
- A production rule is something like:
    - $$AxB \to AyB$$ -- if you see a word $$A$$ followed by the word $$x$$ followed by a word $$B$$, you may replace it with $$AyB$$
    - $$aAb^2cBc \to c^3bABa$$
    - etc
- A __normal__ production is one of the form $$aP \to Pb$$
