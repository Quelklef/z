title: equivalences of regularity and normality

- [[JRM:Top.2]] ยง31.1
- take a [[topological space]] $$X$$ satisfying the [[T1 axiom]]. Then:
    - $$X$$ being [[regular]] is equivalent to: given $$x \in X$$ and open $$U \ni x$$, exists open $$V \ni x$$ where $$\bar V \subseteq U$$
    - $$X$$ being [[normal]] is equivalent to: given closed $$A \subseteq X$$ and open $$U \supseteq A$$, exists open $$V \supseteq A$$ such that $$\bar V \subseteq U$$
