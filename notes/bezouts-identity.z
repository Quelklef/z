\title: Bezout's Identity

\sec: Statement

\jarg<Bezout's Identity> [Bezout's Identity] states, equivalently, that:

  - The gcd of two numbers can be expressed as a linear combination of those numbers
  - Given $d = \text{gcd}(a, b)$, exists $x, y \in \mathbb Z$ such that $ax + by = d$.


\sec: Proof

Special case of \ref gcd-smallest-linear-combination [this theorem].
