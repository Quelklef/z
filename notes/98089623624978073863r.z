[:locally compact:]

- For a [[topological space]] $$X$$, we say that $$X$$ is __locally compact at__ a point $$x_0 \in X$$ if there is a compact subspace $$C \subseteq X$$ which contains a [[neighborhood]] of $$x_0$$
- If $$X$$ is locally compact at all of its points, then we call it just __locally compact__
- Trivially, every [[compact]] space is locally compact (let $$C = X$$)
