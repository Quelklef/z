[:Urysohn lemma:]

- For $$X$$ a [[normal]] space and $$A$$, $$B$$ disjoint [[closed]] subsets of $$X$$, and for $$[a, b] \subseteq \mathbb R$$, exists [[continuous]] $$f : X \to [a, b]$$ where $$f(A) = \{a\}$$ and $$f(B) = \{b\}$$.
- Essentially, if $$X$$ is normal and $$A, B$$ are disjoint and closed, then they can be [[separated by a continuous function]]
