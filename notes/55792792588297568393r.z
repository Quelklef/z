[:language non-compositionality:]

- [original twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Quelklef/status/1255701927385415680)
- We have, for instance, “fearful” which is comprised of the base ‘fear’ and the suffix ‘ful’. And we can combine  other basis with the same suffix: cheerful, merciful, etc. But this seeming order breaks down pretty quickly. For instance, some combinations are deemed unacceptable: “maliceful” is not a word; it’s “malicious”. Other combinations are given meanings that differ from what one may expect: “wonderful” does not mean “full of wonder”
- the meaning of certain phrases or terms become more specific than this compositional structure prescribes. A “blackboard”, for instance, is not just a black board: it’s a board that’s black but also e.g. can be written on with chalk.
