[:chicken sexing:]

- Article: https://commoncog.com/blog/chicken-sexing-and-perceptual-learning-as-a-path-to-expertise/
- Points:
    - Chicken sexing is the act of telling whether a young chick is a male or female
    - Difficult; "chickens don't have penises"
    - Trained sexers "can sort a thousand birds an hour with over 98% accuracy"
    - Trained sexers "can't explain how they know [the sex of a chick]. They just ... do."
    - New sexers are trained purely via feedback: have them sex a chick, then say if they were right or wrong; rinse and repeat "over a period of a few years"
    - Chick sexing is thus an example of [[tacit knowledge]]: the sexers are able to know the sex of a chick, but can't explain how they know
    - Article defined tacit knowledge as "knowledge that canâ€™t be explicitly communicated"

- Points:
    - Machine vision algorithm developed to sex chicks
    - "Accuracies ranged from 50% to 89%", strictly not worse than luck
    - Proves that the tacit knowledge of chicken sexing __can__ be codified, if in the fuzzy language of machine vision
    - Seems to suggest, counter to the previous article, that it's not that the knowledge __can't__ be communicated (a machine vision algorithm is a perfectly precise method of communication), but rather that it's not easy to do so in a human manner; perhaps this is innate to the problem (we will never be able to explain why we can sex a chick) or maybe it's just because we haven't yet made the requisite breakthroughs
