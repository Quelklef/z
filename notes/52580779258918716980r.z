[:regular:]

- a [[topological space]] $$X$$ is said to be __regular__ if it satisfies the [[T1 axiom]] and if for each $$x \in X$$ and closed $$Y \subseteq X$$ not containing $$x$$, there are disjoint open sets respectively containing $$x$$ and $$Y$$
- 
- Subspaces of regular spaces are regular; products of regular spaces are regular ([[JRM:Top.2]] ยง31.2)
