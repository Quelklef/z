[:proof as decomposition:]

- Stop thinking of a lemma/proof/proposition as a rationale for the __certain truth__ of something
- Instead, think of a proof as a deconstruction of a large claim ($$P \Rightarrow Q$$) into a series of smaller claims (the lemmas)
- This idea comes from Proofs and Refutations by Imre Lakatos, but I have not found exactly where
