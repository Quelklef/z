\title: Sample Space

\sec: Definition

A \jarg <sample space(|s)> [sample space] $\Omega$ is a set $\{\omega_1, \dots, \omega_n\}$ of possible outcomes of some probabilistic action, called \jarg <(atomic |)event(|s)> [(atomic) events].

A subset $E \subseteq \Omega$ represents the possibility of \i[any] $\omega \in E$ occuring. Such objects are called \jarg <(compound |)event(|s)> [(compound) events] \aref [rk].
\adef: Yes, the word "event" can mean either kind.
