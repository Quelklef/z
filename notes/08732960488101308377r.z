title: free of desire, how to do anything?

- on LSD, free of desire, I found myself unable to find any reason for doing anything
- when experiencing a craving, disidentifying with mindly things means disengaging with both "indulge the craving" and "dont indulge the craving"
    - sam says the solution here is to identify the personal desire underlying the tension and then follow that
