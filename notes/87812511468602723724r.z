[:linear continuum:]

- A nonempty set $$L$$ with a [[total order]] is called a __linear continuum__ if the following hold:
    - $$L$$ has the least upper bound property, i.e. every nonempty subset of $$L$$ with an upper bound has a least upper bound
    - The order is a [[dense order]], i.e. for every $$a < c$$ exists a $$b$$ s.t. $$a < b < c$$
- Intuition: linear continuums are "$$\mathbb R$$-like" without requiring properties of $$\mathbb R$$ besides order-related ones
