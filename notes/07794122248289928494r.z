title: school prioritizes things you don't care about

- [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Quelklef/status/1193696032254648320)
- in short, in school "work before play" meant "get good grades in stuff you don't care about before you can do things you do care about" and after school it meant "progress on things you do care about before relaxing"
